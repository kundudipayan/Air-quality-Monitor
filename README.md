Air Quality Monitoring System with Echo Voice Web App

Overview
This project is a **smart, IoT-based air quality monitoring system** featuring a custom-built **web application** that enables users to interact with real-time environmental data via voice commands. The system integrates **ESP32 with sensors**, a **ThingSpeak dashboard**, and a **frontend web interface** built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, supported by a secure backend.
Through this intuitive and interactive platform, users can **view live air quality readings**, receive **spoken forecasts**, and issue **voice queries** directly from their browsers‚Äîwithout needing additional devices like physical smart speakers.

Key Frontend Features
**Echo Web Application**:
  A voice-interactive dashboard created with **HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript**

  * Microphone integration for user voice queries
  * Responsive UI with live sensor data and prediction charts
  * Secure login with Channel ID and API key
  * Audio feedback using JavaScript SpeechSynthesis
  * Multi-language support (future scope)

**Real-Time Visualization**:
  Pulls live data from **ThingSpeak API** and displays:

  * Gas concentrations (MQ2, MQ9, MQ135)
  * Temperature & Humidity
  * Air quality predictions (30 mins & 1 hour)

**User Authentication**:

  * Login form captures Channel ID, API Key, and Password
  * Authenticated sessions managed via **tokens**

Frontend Stack

* **HTML** ‚Äì Structure of the dashboard and interaction flow
* **CSS** ‚Äì Responsive and clean UI design
* **JavaScript** ‚Äì

  * Voice assistant logic (SpeechRecognition & SpeechSynthesis APIs)
  * API calls to ThingSpeak and backend server
  * Token handling and session control
  * Real-time chart updates using Chart.js (optional)

 Web App Demo

```bash
üìÅ dashboard/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.html          # Main dashboard UI
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ style.css           # Styling
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ script.js           # Voice assistant logic + data fetching
```

### Key Functionalities:

* Speak commands like:

  * ‚ÄúWhat is the current air quality?‚Äù
  * ‚ÄúGive me temperature and humidity.‚Äù
  * ‚ÄúForecast for next hour?‚Äù
* View:

  * Live charts from ThingSpeak
  * Alerts triggered via threshold checks
  * Predictions generated by the ML model

 System Highlights

* ESP32-based wireless sensing
* Real-time data to ThingSpeak
* Voice assistant without external hardware
* Forecasting with Random Forest model
* Backend powered by Groq, data stored in MongoDB

How to Run

1. **Set up ESP32 + sensors**, and connect to ThingSpeak
2. Clone this repository

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo-name/air-quality-monitor.git
   cd air-quality-monitor/dashboard
   ```
3. Open `index.html` in your browser
4. Enter credentials (Channel ID, API Key, Password)
5. Speak into your microphone to query current/future air quality

Deployment Status
This project is currently not in the deployed phase. All components have been tested locally and are fully functional, but the complete system‚Äîincluding the Echo web application and backend server‚Äîis yet to be hosted on a public domain.
